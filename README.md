# Volume-Control-By-Hand-Gesture
In this project, we can control our system volume by just moving our two fingers. 

It's a python project. Python libraries like cv2 (open-cv lib), numpy, osascript, time and also a python module (HandTrackinModule.py -> made by me) are used in this project.

Tutorial:

-> Use your index finger and thumb in front of camera. 
-> If you move these fingers close to each other then the volume of system will decrease. If you move these fingers away from each other then the volume of system will increase.
-> If we join the tips of both fingers then then the volume of system will get mute.
